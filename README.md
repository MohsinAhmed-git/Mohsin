Pixel manipulation is a technique used for image encryption where the individual pixels of an image are modified to obscure the original content. This makes the image unintelligible without the decryption process. 
Pixel manipulation is a good starting point for understanding image encryption. While it can provide a basic level of security, for robust encryption, it's often combined with more advanced cryptographic algorithms.
